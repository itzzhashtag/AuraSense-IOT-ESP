# AuraSense-IOT-ESP-1 🌐🔧

**AuraSense IOT (ESP-1)** is a dual-ESP32 based real-time room environment monitoring and weather display system. It demonstrates wireless TCP/IP communication between two ESP32 devices, sensor data collection, API integration, and visual output on an LED matrix display.

## 📡 Project Overview

This project creates a smart room dashboard using two ESP32 microcontrollers:

- **Server ESP32:** Collects real-time sensor data (Temperature, Humidity, Air Quality) and transmits it via TCP over Wi-Fi.
- **Client ESP32:** Receives sensor data, displays it on a dual 8x32 LED matrix, fetches weather updates from Weather API, and hosts a local web interface for real-time monitoring.

⚠️ **Important Notice Before Using the Code**

Please make sure to **change the placeholder values and data variables** in the code before running it.

For your convenience, I have added comments indicating the exact **line numbers where changes are needed**.

## 🔧 Features

- 📶 **ESP-to-ESP TCP Communication** on local network.
- 🌡️ **DHT22** for temperature and humidity sensing.
- 🌫️ **MQ-135** for air quality monitoring.
- 🔲 **LED Matrix Display (2 x 8x32)** using MD_MAX72XX and Parola libraries.
- 🌍 **Weather Data** fetched from a Weather API. [Lot of Options] - I personally Chose www.tomorrow.io
- 🕒 **NTP Time Sync** for accurate data logging.
- 🌐 **Web Server UI** for real-time monitoring via browser.
- ♻️ **Auto-Reconnect & Watchdog Timer** for system reliability.
