## 📡 Project Overview

This project builds an intelligent room air-quality dashboard using Many ESP32 microcontrollers:

- **Client ESP3:** Collects Lpg Gas value from MQ5 and DHT11 Sensor Locally and displays it locally on an LCD display with led indicators and sends the data to Client ESP2 over Wi-Fi.
- **Server ESP2:** Collects air quality, temperature, and humidity data, displays it locally on an LCD display with RGB indicators and sends the data to Client ESP1 over Wi-Fi.
- **Client ESP3:** Receives room environment data and external MQ5 sensor data Network connected ESP1, displays information on a dual 8x32 LED matrix, fetches weather data from Weather API, and hosts a real-time web interface.

⚠️ **Important Notice Before Using the Code**

Please make sure to **change the placeholder values and data variables** in the code before running it.

For your convenience, I have added comments indicating the exact **line numbers where changes are needed**.
